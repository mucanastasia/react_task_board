Welcome to the **React Task Board with DnD** project! This is a pet project developed for educational purposes, designed to explore and implement a custom drag-and-drop functionality (DnD without libraries). This project is currently in an active development stage, and new features are being added regularly.

## About the Project

Task Board with DnD is a desktop-only application at this stage, with plans to make it compatible with all devices in the future. The primary goal is to create a task board that aligns with my personal vision of how such a tool should function and appear. This involves focusing on a logical and user-friendly UX/UI design, incorporating feedback from a professional UX/UI designer while initially conceptualizing the design myself.

Additionally, this project aims to challenge myself by implementing the drag-and-drop functionality from scratch, without using external libraries. The intent is to develop a robust and scalable application, tackling decisions on integrating new features within an expanding codebase. I am also trying to cover the project with tests to ensure its reliability and maintainability.

Tasks are stored using the browser's localStorage, ensuring that your data persists between sessions.

## Features

- **Adding, Editing, and Deleting Tasks:** Easily manage your tasks with straightforward controls.
- **Mark Task as Done:** Check a task and automatically move it to the done column.
- **Drag and Drop Functionality:** Intuitively move tasks between different columns.
- **Three Status Columns:** Tasks are organized into three columns representing different statuses.
- **Editing Board Name:** Customize the board name to suit your needs.
- **Light and Dark Mode:** Switch between light and dark themes for a better user experience.
- **Dev Feature - Sample Tasks:** Add a sample list of tasks for testing and development purposes and delete them when needed.

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mucanastasia/react_task_board.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd react_task_board
    ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start

Once the development server is running, you can access the task board application in your browser at http://localhost:3000

## Testing

This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing. To run the tests, follow these steps:

**Run the Tests:**
```sh
npm test
```
## Future Plans

  * Adding More Task Boards: Allow users to create and manage multiple task boards.
  * Main Page with Statistics: Create a main page where users can view statistics about their tasks and boards.
  * Mobile and Tablet Support: Adapt the drag-and-drop functionality for mobile and tablet devices.
